        <p><em>Founder-Acaria of <strong>The International Society For Krishna Consciousness.</strong></em></p>
        <p>Abhay Charanaravinda Bhaktivedanta Swami (IAST: Abhaya Caraṇāravinda Bhakti-vedānta Svāmī; 1 September 1896 – 14 November 1977), born Abhay Charan De, was an Indian spiritual teacher and the founder-preceptor of the International Society
          for Krishna Consciousness[2] (ISKCON), commonly known as the "Hare Krishna Movement". Members of the ISKCON movement view Bhaktivedānta Swāmi as a representative and messenger of Krishna Chaitanya.[3][4][5][6] Within the society he is
          commonly
          referred to as (Srila) Prabhupāda.</p>

  <h3><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhagavad_Gita">Books and publishing</a></strong></h3>
  <p>
  <ul>
    <li>Bhaktivedanta Swami's most significant contribution is considered to be his books.[58][59] During the final twelve years of his life, Bhaktivedanta Swami translated over sixty volumes of classic Vedic scriptures (such as the Bhagavad Gita,
      Chaitanya Charitamritaand the Srimad Bhagavatam) into the English language.[48] For their authority, depth and clarity, his books have won praise from professors at colleges and universities like Harvard, Oxford, Cornell, Columbia, Syracuse,
      Oberlin, and Edinburgh,[60] and his Bhagavad-gītā As It Is was published by Macmillan Publishers in 1968 with an unabridged edition in 1972.[61][62][63] It is now available in over sixty languages around the world and some other books by
      Bhaktivedanta Swami are available in over eighty different languages.[26][50] In February 2014, ISKCON's news agency reported to have reached a milestone of distributing over half a billion books authored by Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada,
      since 1965.[19]
    </li>
    <li>The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust was established in 1972 to publish his works, and it has also published his multi-volume biography, Srila Prabhupada-lilamrta, that according to Larry Shinn, will "certainly be one of the most complete records of
      the life and work of any modern religious figure".[2][64] Prabhupada reminded his devotees before his death that he would live forever in his books, and through them would remain present as a spiritual master or guru.[65] Bhaktivedanta Swami
      had instilled in his followers an understanding of the importance of writing and publishing not only with regard to his works, but also their own initiatives. His early disciples felt Prabhupada had given them Back To Godhead for their own
      writings from the very start.[65]
    </li>
    <li>A prominent Gaudiya Vaishnava figure, Shrivatsa Goswami, who as a young man had met Bhaktivedanta Swami in 1972, affirmed the significance of book publishing and distribution in spreading the message of Caitanya in an interview with Steven
      Gelberg:[65]</li>

  <ol>
    <li>Beginning his public preaching mission in India, he founded the League of Devotees in Jhansi in 1953.[71]</li>
    <li>Following the establishment of temples and centres in the United States and Europe, he returned to India in 1971, holding many public programs which were well attended.</li>
    <li>In 1996, the Government of India recognized his accomplishments by issuing a commemorative stamp in his honour as a part of Prabhupada Centennial celebrations.</li>
    <li>A number of memorial samadhis or shrines to Bhaktivedanta Swami were constructed by the members of ISKCON in his remembrance, the largest of which are in Mayapur, Vrindavan and at the larger sized temples in the United States. Prabhupada's
      Palace of Gold was designed and constructed by devotees of the New Vrindavan community and dedicated on 2 September 1979. Back in 1972 it was intended to be simply a residence for Bhaktivedanta Swami, but over time the plans evolved into an
      ornate marble and gold palace which is now visited by thousands of Hindu pilgrims each year, visiting this centrepiece of the community strongly relying upon tourist trade</li>
